    <string name="resettlement_desc"><b>What is Resettlement?</b>\n
Resettlement is the transfer from the first country that a refugee flees to (i.e. Jordan), to another country which has screened the case and agreed to admit the individual/family and provide permanent residence (the Resettlement State).\n

Resettlement is a process which results in a permanent third country solution for refugees who have no option to integrate locally or return to their home country and have protection needs in the country where they stay.\n

Resettlement is available for refugees whose life, liberty, safety, health or fundamental human rights are at risk in the country where they sought refuge.\n\n

<b>How are refugees identified for resettlement?</b>\n
UNHCR identifies refugees for resettlement in accordance with resettlement categories based on their protection needs. Resettlement States set the criteria which determine which refugees will be admitted to their country.\n

<b>Refugees do not apply for resettlement.</b> Cases are identified through the data and information that is shared with the office at registration level, as well as information gathered by partners and during home visits.\n

Identification for resettlement <b>is not linked</b> to the date of registration with the office, nationality or any other profile.\n

UNHCR identifies refugees based on their protection needs and continuously reviews the situation of highly vulnerable families to assess whether they meet resettlement criteria.\n

<b>Resettlement is not a right</b> and is not available to everyone granted refugee status. Places are limited and Resettlement States choose how many refugees to resettle.\n\n
